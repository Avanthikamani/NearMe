                In the bustling streets of commerce that characterised the Madras of 1964, 
                GRT Jewelers came into being as a brainchild of Shri G. Rajendran. 
                Our modest genesis soon grew into a retail jewellery outlet loved by you the customers who now lovingly call us 'GRT'.
